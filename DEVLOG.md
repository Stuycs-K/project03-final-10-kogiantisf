### 2025-01-07 - Came up with project idea and added info to README.
I spent most of the usable time in a period (25min) thinking of a project that would cover most of the topics we
discussed in class. I then added all that I came up with to README, but because I was doing it on my personal website I forgot to push it.

### 2024-01-08 - Wrote proposal, filled out devlog, and started on function organization
I wrote a rough proposal and touched up the README, which took most of class time (20min).
I also wrote this devlog which I forgot to do yesterday.
Rest of the time in class was spent on organizing the functions I would be using (ON PAPER, I'll upload photos later tonight).

### 2024-01-09 - started writing some functions
spent entire class time explicitly describing functions in one file (which I forgot to add)
at home implemented the functions but did not test

### 2024-01-10 - started describing server/player functions
In class time created player.c/.h and server.c/.h, described functions and will modify from last lab for handshake

### 2024-01-11 - no work

### 2024-01-12 - looking back at design
thought some more about the design of the entire server, but didn't code (20min)
