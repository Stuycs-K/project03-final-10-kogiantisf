# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Filippos
       
# Intentions:

A statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project.
  I want to create a platform where players can sign up, and join an ongoing session of poker.
  the main code will be on shared memory between players, matchmaking/joining a game, and creating accounts for players (and storing them in files).
# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface).

  Players will ssh onto a lab computer,
  run the program,
  they will be prompted with a sign-in page, or guest
  they then will placed in a lobby, waiting for a round of a game to finish or for more players to be in the lobby for a game to start.
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
     


How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
  I (Filippos) am responsible for everything
What data structures you will be using and how.
  I will be using arrays (), structs (for some game mechanics), and csv's (for storing player stats)
What algorithms and /or data structures you will be using, and how.
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.
  by monday (13) have the game(server) set up. By Wednesday have coded the game entirely, so it is playable.
